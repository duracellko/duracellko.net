Simple Azure Virtual Machines Manager is minimalistic web portal to start and stop Azure virtual machines. It enables you to start, stop and connect to virtual machines in Microsoft Azure. It might be very useful in cases:

* You use [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/) for software testing and you want to save costs by running virtual machines only when testers really use them.
* You want your virtual machines to run only when needed.
* You want people to be able to start/stop virtual machines without access to full [Azure Portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/).

It is possible very easy to enable access only to users in your [Azure Active Directory](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/active-directory/).
