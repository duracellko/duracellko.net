There was a Bing application in Windows 8 that displayed image of the day. I used this application to check out Bing image every day. However, in Windows 8.1 the Bing search was completely redesigned. Although the new search is much more powerful, there is no way to easily see Bing image every day in a live tile. So I decided to fill this gap and created “Bing Image of the Day” application. The application is very similar to the old one. It displays images at screen and in live tile. Additionally it can change your lock screen image every day.
