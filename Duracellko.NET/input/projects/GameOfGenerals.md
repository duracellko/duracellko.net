Game of Generals is strategic board game for 2 persons + arbiter. Main objective is to capture opponent's flag, while pieces on board are eliminated based on ranks. Task of arbiter is to decide which piece is eliminated without exposing ranks to players. More information about the game and rules can be found in Wikipedia article.

Goal of this project is to eliminate need of arbiter in play. In fact computer can do this task. Multiplayer is available over LAN. The game is not finished yet. At the moment you can play it, but it is stable. And most important UI is very very simple. Actually I stopped at my incompetence to design nice UI.

As the game is not finished, I decided not to publish it under open source. However, if you would like to contribute (mostly appeal on UI), do not hesitate to contact me.
