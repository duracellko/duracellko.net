Planning Poker web application allows distributed teams to play planning poker using just their web browser. The application does not require any registration at all. Scrum Master just creates a team and all other members connect to the team. Observer role is supported too. The observer can watch the game, but cannot play planning poker. This is perfect role for product owner.
